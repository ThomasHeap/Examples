        "This is the tutorial of the 2024 [Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.m2lschool.org/) on Natural Language Processing!\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will explore the fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Basic Python programming skills are expected.\n",
        "Prior knowledge of standard NLP techniques (e.g. text tokenization and classification with ML) is beneficial but optional when working through the notebooks as they assume minimal prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial combines detailed analysis and development of essential NLP concepts via custom (i.e. from scratch) implementations. Other necessary NLP components will be developed using PyTorch's NLP library implementations. As a result, the tutorial offers deep understanding and facilitates easy usage in future applications.\n",

        "  - **Example:** It creates tokens based on byte pairs, such as \"b\" and \"an\" merging into a single token of \"ban\".\n",
        "4. **WordPiece Tokenization:**\n",
        "  - **Description:** WordPiece tokenization breaks words into smaller units. It begins with a basic vocabulary of individual characters and merges the most frequent character sequences to form new tokens. Used by e.g. BERT, DistilBERT, and Electra.\n",

First, each integer defined through the tokenization process is assigned a random vector that is learnable, meaning the training process will change its values. That random vector is called embedding, so each word in the sentence will be represented by a learnable vector.\n",
